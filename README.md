## Leaflet-Challenge

### Level 1: Basic Visualization

* The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes.  Use the link (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) to get the data set to visualize. Get 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days', use the URL of the JSON to pull in the data for the visualization.

* Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

* The data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.

* Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

* Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.


### Level 2: More Map Layers

* Add a number of base maps that can be turned on and off independently.

* Add layer controls to our map.

### More map options

* Create a Clusters map
* Create a Heatmap
